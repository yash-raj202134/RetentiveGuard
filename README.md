**RetentiveGuard** is a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or a Large Language Model (LLM). This innovative project leverages natural language processing and deep learning techniques to differentiate between human-written and LLM-generated essays.

## Features

- **Essay Prompt Analysis**: Detects essays written in response to specific prompts, understanding their content and context.
- **LLM vs. Human Essay Identification**: Accurately distinguishes between essays written by students and essays generated by an LLM.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Accepts essays with or without source texts, reflecting the variety of real-world scenarios.
- **Training and Testing**: Utilizes essays from two prompts for training and the remaining prompts for testing.
- **High Accuracy**: Provides high precision in distinguishing between the two essay sources.

## Dataset

The project uses a unique dataset composed of essays written in response to one of seven essay prompts:

- **Training Set**: Composed mainly of student-written essays with a few generated essays.
- **Test Set**: A hidden set of essays used to evaluate model performance.
